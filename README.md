## Idea
Create a random chat room website where users can either create a room with a set topic or join a random room where they'll be thrown into a chat with an odd number of people to talk about the set topic.

Rooms will start with 3 people and as the conversation duration progress more people will be thrown into the chat to keep it going. There will always be an odd number of people so the room can't be 50/50.

When a new user gets thrown into the chat it will feed them the previous messages so they can quickly catch up on the talk.

Members of the chat will have buttons that will allow to pick their side at any given time so everyone can see the diversity on the topic.
